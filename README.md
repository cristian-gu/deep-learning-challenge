## About
Using methods of tuning and data cleaning, we will implement deep learninng techniques to be able to see whether our model tests and predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup using a given dataset with multiple features.

The scope covered in this module includes using binning and data manipulation alongside tuning with the keras sequential model within tensorflow to obtain the passing accuracy threshold. 

## Getting Started
Using Google Colab will allow us to utilize tensorflow and all cross functioning dependencies to work interdependent with each other by using a cloud based environment

Simply:
    - go to https://colab.google/
    - "Open Colab"
    - Upload the starter file to get started

## Installing 
Install dependencies by initializing them in primary kernal.
Dependencies included:
    - sklearn.model_selection, sklearn.preprocessing
    - pandas
    - tensorflow
